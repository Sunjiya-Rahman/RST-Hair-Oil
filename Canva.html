Canva is an Australian multinational proprietary software company that provides a graphic design platform that provides tools for creating social media graphics, presentations, postcards, promotional merchandise and websites.[6][7][8] Launched in Australia in 2013, the service offers design tools for individuals and companies.[9][10] Its offerings include templates for presentations, posters, and social media content, as well as functionalities for photo and video editing. <br>
The platform uses a drag-and-drop interface intended to simplify the design process. Canva operates on a freemium model and has expanded its services over the years to include a print product platform and a video editing tool.
In May 2019, Canva experienced a data breach in which the data of roughly 139 million users was exposed.[38] The exposed data included real names of users, usernames, email addresses, geographical information, and password hashes for some users.[39] Later in January 2020, approximately 4 million user passwords were decrypted and shared online.[40] Canva responded by resetting the passwords of every user who had not changed their password since the initial breach.</p>

What is a Canva Template? <br>
A Canva template is a pre-designed layout that you can customize to fit your needs. Templates help save time and guide users in creating professional-looking content. <br>
For example: <br>
A resume template in Canva has all the sections laid outâ€”just add your details. <br>

A social media post template includes fonts, colors, and design suited to a specific platform (e.g., Instagram square format).</p>
