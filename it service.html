        <h1>What is an IT Service Provider?</h1>
        <img src="it.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>An IT service provider is an IT business/vendor that anticipates the needs of organizations and delivers various IT services and solutions.

An IT service provider (or managed service provider) is a business that maintains and monitors an organization's IT systems, infrastructure and end-user systems regularly. This company has the expertise, resources and license to do so. 

Although a service provider (SP) can be a sub-unit of the organization (internal team), it is often a third-party or outsourced vendor. <br>
SPs may focus on one vendor or technology (Ppre-play SPs), usually their own core offerings or deliver their native services in conjunction with other MSPs. For example, a security MSP may provide cloud security and admin on top of a third-party cloud SaaS. <br>
A service provider's delivery model generally differs from conventional IT product (developers or manufacturers) support. <br> Typically, a service provider doesn't require a user/organization to purchase an IT product. Rather, it builds, operates and manages IT products bundled and delivered as a service. In turn, a customer accesses the solution from a service provider through various sourcing models, such as an on-demand, monthly or annual subscription fee.</p>
